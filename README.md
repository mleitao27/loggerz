## loggerz-server
Generic loggging server implementation for mongodb.
### Setup
1 - Provide an endpoint function implementation in the modules directory. The endpoints and functions called by each of them can be found in the API reference. You may use the middleware and services directories to hold any other sw that you find convenient.
2 - Provide an .env file with the necessary variables for the server to function properly.
